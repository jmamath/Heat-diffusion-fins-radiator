# Heat-diffusion-fins-radiator

## Introduction
In this project we are going to study the diffusion of heat on a fins' radiator. The problem is formulated with the relevant math equations in the document **simulation.pdf** as it is more convenient to have a separate file for LaTeX equations. In this **Readme.md** we are going to pactically describe how run the simulation and get those results.
